[Unit]
Description=Mount crypto_plain_%I per udisks
Documentation=https://github.com/Olf0/crypto-sdcard
After=udisks2.service cryptosd-plain@crypto_plain_%i.service dev-mapper-crypto_plain_%i.device start-user-session.service
Requires=udisks2.service cryptosd-plain@crypto_plain_%i.service
# This is not neccessary here, and prevents this unit from auto-starting
# its dependencies, when called manually:
# Requisite=dev-mapper-crypto_plain_%i.device
# Also conflict with umount.target (see man 7 systemd.special), as
# this is a mounting unit, though not a mount unit:
Conflicts=umount.target rescue.target actdead.target factory-test.target
# Ensure that this Unit is processed before alien-service-manager
# is started (and even more importantly that it is shut down, *after*
# alien-service-manager is shut down), to allow for e.g. (and more),
# android_storage on encrypted SD-card:
Before=alien-service-manager.service umount.target
